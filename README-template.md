### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I have learned how to center an SVG in the middle of an image. I also learned how to use tailwind's group class to trigger animations. Using group allowed me to animate both the profile ring and profile text when hovering.

### Continued development

I would simplify the code more, and look into using more accurate HTML5 tags. I would also adjust font properties such as 'font-space' to make the text match the design better.
